    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose your mean of transport.** Bicycle works great, walking should too. Motorized vehicles may be served better by real-time online services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Track all your trips** using that mean of transport. Start the tracking before you leave, stop the tracking after you arrive. Ride/walk/drive normally, stop at lights, don't speed. OsmAnd works great (list of other apps needed). 1 or 2 seconds tracking interval is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add POIs (and intersections) as waypoints.** Transfer all GPX files to your computer. Load all of them into some GPX editor (JOSM works great).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a new GPX file with waypoints** and add all points of interest (home, work, or any place where you started, deliberately paused or ended a trip) with an attribute `name=…`. Then add unnamed waypoints on each intersection where your tracks cross, split, or join. This is the biggest future plan in *pygohome* to offer a good editor with checks for consistency. Now you have to do it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the cell below** and an empty map will appear. All the action happens here from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Load your GPX files** with the tracks AND the file with waypoints. The current limit is 10MB for one upload, so if you have more data, do it in more batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Find the fastest route** where `src` and `dst` are the names of the POIs and `Quantile` is the a float number between `0.0` (take into account your best time on each road segment) and `1.0` (worst time), while `0.8` is considered a safe value."
